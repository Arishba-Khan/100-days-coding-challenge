Q24-More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests. Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:
• Tests for equality and inequality with strings
• Tests using the lower case function
• Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to
• Tests using "and" and "or" operators
• Test whether an item is in a array
• Test whether an item is not in a array

Q25-Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

Q26-Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
• If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
• If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
• Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.
